# The contract

This is what lets us work in parallel. The Blender model, the web console, and the backend all use the same IDs and the same API.

If you need to change something here, change this file in the same commit and tell the team.

## Asset IDs

The field below is a placeholder until we have sponsor data. Change the numbers if needed, but keep the naming pattern.

| Asset | IDs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tanks | `TANK_1` to `TANK_6` | |
| Tank fill meshes | `TANK_1_LEVEL` to `TANK_6_LEVEL` | Scaled by the web console to show the level |
| Transfer pumps | `PUMP_1` to `PUMP_6` | One per tank |
| Discharge valves | `VALVE_D_1` to `VALVE_D_6` | One per pump |
| Crossover valve | `VALVE_XO_34` | Connects Tank 3 and Tank 4 |
| Wells | `WELL_1` to `WELL_24` | 4 per tank |
| Disposal wells | `SWD_1`, `SWD_2` | |
| Trucks | `TRUCK_1`, `TRUCK_2` | |
| Truck yard | `YARD_1` | |

**Tonight's failure:** `PUMP_3` trips at 1:47 AM.

## Blender rules

The web console finds objects by name, so names matter more than anything else here.

1. **The object name is the asset ID**, spelled exactly as above.
2. **No `.001` suffixes.** Blender adds them to duplicates, and they break name matching. Check before every export.
3. **Assets with many parts:** Put them under one parent Empty named with the ID, like `PUMP_3`. Clicking a child will select the parent. Children can use names like `PUMP_3_motor`.
4. **Tank fill meshes:** Set the origin at the tank floor and model them at full height, so scaling Y from 0 to 1 goes from empty to full. The tank shell has to let the fill be seen, either with a cutaway or a see-through material.
5. **Scale:** 1 Blender unit is 1 meter. Apply transforms before exporting, except where an origin has to stay put for rule 4.
6. **Color:** Model everything in neutral gray and steel. The web console adds status color. Don't paint status into the model.
7. **Materials:** Use Principled BSDF, because other node setups may not export correctly. Keep textures at 2K or below.
8. **Budget:** Aim for under 300,000 triangles and under 30 MB so it runs smoothly on a laptop at the expo.

**Exporting:** File, Export, glTF 2.0. Use the glTF Binary (`.glb`) format, keep the default +Y Up, and turn Apply Modifiers on. Leave Draco compression off at first.

Save the source as `blender/field.blend` and the export as `blender/field.glb`.

**Push a rough version first.** Plain boxes with the correct names are enough for the web console to start. Then improve the quality without changing the names.

## Status colors

The backend sends the status. The web console picks the color.

| Status | Meaning | Look |
|---|---|---|
| `OK` | Normal | Gray, no color |
| `WARNING` | Needs attention soon | Amber |
| `ALARM` | Failed or at risk now | Red |
| `OFFLINE` | Stopped or shut in | Dark |

## API

The default server address is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. All numbers below are examples. Times are minutes from now.

The server allows cross-origin requests (`CORS_ORIGINS`, default `*`), so the web console can run on its own dev port. Responses may carry more fields than shown here; clients should ignore what they don't use.

**Realtime:** everything below is also pushed over `ws://<host>:8000/ws`, along with telemetry, alerts, Jarvis replies and `ui` directives that drive the 3D camera. See [backend/README.md](../backend/README.md) for the message list.

### `GET /api/field`

Everything that doesn't change during the night.

```json
{
  "tanks": [{ "id": "TANK_3", "capacity_bbl": 1000, "shutdown_pct": 90 }],
  "pumps": [{ "id": "PUMP_3", "tank_id": "TANK_3", "rate_bbl_hr": 150 }],
  "valves": [{ "id": "VALVE_XO_34", "connects": ["TANK_3", "TANK_4"] }],
  "wells": [{ "id": "WELL_9", "tank_id": "TANK_3", "water_bbl_hr": 20, "lost_usd_hr": 300 }],
  "disposal_wells": [{ "id": "SWD_1", "max_bbl_hr": 600 }],
  "trucks": [{ "id": "TRUCK_1", "capacity_bbl": 130, "minutes_to": { "TANK_3": 35 } }]
}
```

### `GET /api/state`

The current readings and any active incident.

```json
{
  "clock": "01:47",
  "assets": {
    "TANK_3": { "status": "ALARM", "level_pct": 71.2 },
    "PUMP_3": { "status": "ALARM", "reason": "Pump tripped. No flow since 1:47 AM." },
    "VALVE_XO_34": { "status": "OK", "position": "CLOSED" }
  },
  "incident": { "root_asset_id": "PUMP_3", "summary": "Pump 3 failed. Tank 3 is filling." }
}
```

### `POST /api/forecast`

**This is the most important endpoint.** Send a list of actions and get back the future. An empty list means "do nothing." It must be fast enough to feel instant when clicking.

Request:

```json
{
  "horizon_minutes": 360,
  "step_minutes": 5,
  "actions": [
    { "type": "SET_VALVE", "asset_id": "VALVE_XO_34", "value": "OPEN", "at_min": 5 },
    { "type": "CHOKE_WELL", "asset_id": "WELL_9", "value": 0.5, "at_min": 10 },
    { "type": "SEND_TRUCK", "asset_id": "TRUCK_1", "target_id": "TANK_3", "at_min": 0 }
  ]
}
```

Action types: `SET_VALVE`, `SET_PUMP`, `CHOKE_WELL`, `SEND_TRUCK`.

Response:

```json
{
  "timeline": [
    { "t_min": 0, "tanks": { "TANK_3": 71.2 }, "wells_online": 24 },
    { "t_min": 5, "tanks": { "TANK_3": 72.8 }, "wells_online": 24 }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "SHUTDOWN_LEVEL",
      "asset_id": "TANK_3",
      "t_min": 60,
      "t_min_low": 45,
      "t_min_high": 75,
      "text": "Tank 3 reaches shutdown at 2:47 AM"
    }
  ],
  "cost": { "total_usd": 4200, "trucking_usd": 1500, "disposal_usd": 700, "lost_production_usd": 2000 },
  "warnings": []
}
```

If data is missing or stale, say so in `warnings`. **Never report a tank as safe because there's no data.**

### `POST /api/plans`

Returns the best plans, cheapest first. It must always return something, even if not every tank can be saved.

Request body is optional: `{ "horizon_minutes": 360 }`. Each call replaces the previous plan IDs. Plans also carry `robust` (still holds if inflow runs 15% high), `notes`, and `recommended` on the first one.

```json
{
  "plans": [
    {
      "id": "plan_1",
      "summary": "Open the Tank 3 to 4 crossover and send one truck.",
      "actions": [{ "type": "SET_VALVE", "asset_id": "VALVE_XO_34", "value": "OPEN", "at_min": 5 }],
      "cost": { "total_usd": 4200 },
      "keeps_running": true,
      "cannot_save": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/plans/{id}/approve`

Turns a plan into the steps the 3D scene walks through. Optional body `{ "by": "Vinay", "execute": true }`. With `execute` (the default) the live field carries out each step when it's due and broadcasts `plan_step`.

```json
{
  "steps": [
    { "n": 1, "asset_id": "VALVE_XO_34", "text": "Open the Tank 3 to 4 crossover." },
    { "n": 2, "asset_id": "TRUCK_1", "text": "Send Truck 1 to Tank 3. Arrives in 35 minutes." }
  ],
  "radio_script": "Field, this is control. Pump 3 is down..."
}
```
